				header and footer.

				It's use cases are simple hierarchies with top or fixed,
				small form navigation and inline linking.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some files on this server are rendered using <span
				class="math">\KaTeX</span> as well, simply to show some
				other capabilities.
			</p>
			<p class="math text-center">
				x = \dfrac{-b &plusmn; \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}
